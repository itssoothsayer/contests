    <h1><u>Welcome to the Beagle Blog</u></h1>

    <p>The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle was
        developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking
        instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and
        foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack
        of inherited health problems.</p>
